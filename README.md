# FileEnumerator
The functionality of creating a new folder using a name based on an existing file/folder currently works but errors are currently handled using print statements.

Actual enumerator is work in progress. Hopefully it will be able to rename a list of files using String.format() and enumeration. Maybe make new directories for the files to go in. Ideally should be able to read Chinese and usable by my dad. It has one of my earliest GUI designs so it is currently horrible to use.
